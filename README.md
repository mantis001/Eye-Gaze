# Eye Gaze Detection from Video

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing eye gaze behavior from video files. It includes preprocessing steps, video format conversion, and tracking using computer vision techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The notebook processes `.webm` video files and converts them into `.mp4` using FFmpeg, then applies computer vision techniques (via OpenCV) to detect and track eye movements. This setup can be used for behavioral analysis, HCI research, or assistive technologies.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- FFmpeg (via subprocess)
- Matplotlib
- IPython Display

## ðŸŽ¥ Key Features

- Converts `.webm` videos to `.mp4` format automatically
- Loads and processes video frames using OpenCV
- Prepares eye gaze data for further analysis or visualization
